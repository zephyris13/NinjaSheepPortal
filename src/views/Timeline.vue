        <h4>2030</h4>
        <p>Work starts on high energy focusing. The aim is to create an energy bridge between two points in space. Research is headed by a local corporation based in Japan, called "Shiro Sakura R&D Corporation".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2031</h4>
        <p>A year after the research started, limited distance energy bridges are successfully created, resulting in much faster computer networks, and leading to increasingly superior connectivity and expedited research.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2031 - July</h4>
        <p>Anomalies start being noticed, causing some data transfered over the bridges being lost, but still receiving a response nonetheless...</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2031 - September</h4>
        <p>Further research is prompted into these anomalies, after which it was found that the energy bridge was 'jumping' to another link point...a link point that wasn't part of the original energy bridge.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2031 - October</h4>
        <p>Scientists are still baffled by this discovery. In the meantime many energy bridges are being shut down as a safety precaution, due to the random 'jumping' occuring more frequently and disrupting communications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2031 - December</h4>
        <p>Researchers keep investigating how and why energy bridges seem to randomly connect to external points. A particular duo comes up with the theory that somewhere in the universe there must be similar energy signatures, to which the bridges are linking to. It is deemed a priority to keep a control chamber that keeps randomly generating new energy bridges. This fact is kept under wraps, as to reduce the possibility of authorities shutting down the project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2032 - January</h4>
        <p>As people were still celebrating, the scientists have the first major break-through. A reply signal is received in the control chamber, a data packet consisting of sound, a message - "Hello...who are you?"</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2032 - February - July</h4>
        <p>After much deliberation, fear and even astonishment, an uneasy communication protocol was set up with "the other side". Using the control chamber, scientist of this universe would communicate with scientists from the other unvierse. This information was kept secret from the public, and as such was done under much scrutiny, however higher authorities started being kept in the loop again. It was eventually discovered that the scientists and people of the other universe were also experimenting with similar energy bridges concepts, and the close proximity of the dimension function enabled energy bridges to jump easily across the two dimensions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2032 - July 7th</h4>
        <p>A committee is formed by members of both universes, scientists and civilians alike, thus being able to share knowledge and research more freely. The whole discovery is finally released to the public.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2033 - July 7th</h4>
        <p>A year passed. Research and technology has progressed in leaps and bounds. Energy bridges have been re-established, pooling resources from multiple universes. The committee keeps growing, adding people from the various dimensions that the bridges connect to...each dimension slightly different, all unified by this discovery.</p>
        <p>The team of the two researchers who lead to this discovery get a commendation and are recognised across most dimensions as the fathers of the dimension continuum. This universe being designated as the Prime Universe, the team becomes known as the Zephyris Team, and take lead of the whole project.</p>
